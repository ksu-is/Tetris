# Tetris 

Iâ€™ve been a big fan of video games since I was a child. And I continue to be one now way into adulthood. I have always been curious on how video games were created.  One game I am a fan of is also one of the most popular games of all time is Tetris. Now that I have learned a lot of the basics and fundamentals of Python, I now wish to recreate that game using the language. This game would be for anyone who loves videos game or puzzles. It involves blocks of different shapes fallings from the top of the screen to the bottom. And as they stack upon each other the objective would be to get a row of blocks to line up, which will in turn clear that row to clear out to make room for more blocks. As the game progresses the speed of which the blocks fall increases, making the player think faster on their feet. The game is then over when the blocks stack up to the stop of the screen where there is no more room left. This project will only require one person to complete so I will be tackling this alone. An example of this code I have found on the website Github. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Will require a machine Python 3. What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Copy the code into a python envirornment and run the code.


## Playing the game

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
